/*
Package timefmt enables easy human input of times, dates, and durations. It also includes many convenience functions for rouding time duration boundaries as
is frequently needed for scheduling and time-based search applications.

Pointers to time.Time are used throughout the package since <nil> is usually a more desirable zero value than that for time.Time without a pointer.
